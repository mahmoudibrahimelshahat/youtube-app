# youtube-app
this project goals is to integrate with specific channel and get its videos and do some functionality like search , pagination and sort


so first thing when we open project we go to home page that api exist on it so we get list of videos on spcific channel and we can do sorting ,
paging, search for each video and on navbar we can put id of another channel to get its videos anyway 

after we get videos we can go to see details of this video and we can add to favorite and rate you can also check local storage too 
from local storage we can get items that exist like favorite list or rating list and we can show them in video details

for first bouns unfortunalty maybe i will search for it but i think this will take me  long time 
for second bouns i make gulp.js and write some code to minify file (js) that exist on app and to increase preformance 
for third bouns  i make input like search to put channel id and every change you can see videos of this channel

Note >> key that used to get every call api is static and this key have limit quotes like 100mb i don't know for real but when this error show 403 
i make new project on google api and put the new key that is all :)

:) have fun and wish me good luck
